## About
This project is a text-based implementation of the classic battleship game in Java. The game allows two players to take turns placing ships on a grid and attacking each other's ships. Players can input coordinates to target enemy ships, and the game provides feedback on hits, misses, and sunk ships. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and user input handling.

## Features
1. *Player Interaction:* Players can input ship coordinates and target enemy ships during their turns.
2. *Ship Placement:* Players can place ships on the grid, ensuring proper positioning and avoiding overlap.
3. *Hit Detection:* The game accurately detects hits, misses, and sunk ships, providing feedback to players.
4. *Game Over Condition:* The game ends when all ships of one player are sunk, and a victory message is displayed.

Other parts are instructed via the game console.
